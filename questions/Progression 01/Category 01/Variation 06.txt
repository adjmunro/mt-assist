Given the following:

s1 = 'Aussie'
s2 = 'Oy'
s3 = '!'
s4 = ' '
x = 3
        
Write an expression using only these variables that will evaluate to:
        
         'Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oy! Oy! Oy! '

You should use concatenation and any other suitable operators.

Each variable must be used at least once.

You will need to show a demonstrator that it works.
