Given the following:

        s1 = 'hello'
        s2 = 'to' 
        s3 = 'you'
        s4=  ' '
        s5 = '!'
        n = 2
        
Write an expression using only these variables that will evaluate to:

         'hello to you! hello to you! ' 

You should use concatenation and any other suitable operators.

Each variable must be used at least once.

You will need to show a demonstrator that it works.
