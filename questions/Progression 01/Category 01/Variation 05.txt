Given the following:
        s1 = 'What a'
        s2 = 'very'
        s3 = 'day'
        s4 = ','
        s5 = ' '
        s6 = 'nice'
        x = 3
        
Write an expression using only these variables that will evaluate to:

         'What a very, very, very, nice day'

You should use concatenation and any other suitable operators.

Each variable must be used at least once.

You will need to show a demonstrator that it works.
