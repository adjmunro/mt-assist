Write a function that takes a string and a list of integers and returns a list of characters.  
Where the ord of a character in the string matches the number in the list at the same index as 
the character, that character should be included in the list returned by the function.


If the list of numbers is shorter than the string then the remaining characters in the string 
should be added as separate elements to the returned list.

If the list of numbers is longer than the string then the extra numbers in the list should be 
ignored.

Your function should pass the following doctests:

def matching_ord_nums(string, ord_nums):
    '''
    >>> matching_ord_nums('abc', [97, 100, 99])
    ['a', 'c']
    >>> matching_ord_nums('abc', [97, 100, 99, 34, 98, 100])
    ['a', 'c']
    >>> matching_ord_nums('abcdef', [97, 100, 99])
    ['a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    >>> matching_ord_nums("{}|['%", [97, 100, 99, 34, 98, 100])
    []
    >>> matching_ord_nums('abc', [97, 97, 99])
    ['a', 'c']
    '''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)
