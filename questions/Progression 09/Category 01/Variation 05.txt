        In mathematics, a square-free, or quadratfrei (from German language) integer, is an 
        integer which is divisible by no other perfect square than 1. For example, 10 is 
        square-free but 18 is not, as 18 is divisible by 9 (which is, of course, the square of 3)

Write a function that takes two parameters. The function should return a string containing all the 
square-free integers between the two numbers (inclusive). In the string each integer should be 
followed by a space.

You may find it easier to encapsulate, using another function that simply checks if one number is 
square-free.

Your function should pass the following doctests:


def square_free_nums(x, n):
    '''
    >>> square_free_nums(10, 20)
    '10 11 13 14 15 17 19 '
    >>> square_free_nums(70, 97)
    '70 71 73 74 77 78 79 82 83 85 86 87 89 91 93 94 95 97 '
    '''
    
if __name__ == '__main__':        
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)

Hint: 

An easy way to determine if an integer, num, is square is to check 

        num ** 0.5 % 1 == 0

Or alternatively:

        num ** 0.5 == int(num ** 0.5)
