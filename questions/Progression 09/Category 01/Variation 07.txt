Most Vowels
Write a function that takes a string containing zero or more words (separated by spaces). The function 
should return the index/position of the word containing the most vowels. 
Note: The first word, if there is one, occupies position zero.

If more than one word has the highest number of vowels your function should return the highest index. 
If none of the words contain vowels the function should return -1.

The function should pass the doctests shown below: 

def find_word_with_most_vowels(s):
    '''
    >>> find_word_with_most_vowels('I would like to climb an extremely tall tree')
6
    >>> find_word_with_most_vowels('a ae aeiou aei aeio')
2
    >>> find_word_with_most_vowels('q qq qqq qqq qqq')
-1
    >>> find_word_with_most_vowels('I would like to climb an very tall tree')
8
    >>> find_word_with_most_vowels('a')
0
    >>> find_word_with_most_vowels('')
-1
