Write a function that takes 
                - the name of a file containing data about cities. 
                - the name of a destination file to which output is written

Each line of the data file contains the name of a city, the country it is in and its population. 
These pieces of information are separated by commas. At the moment the cities are in alphabetical
order. Your function should write the same information to the destination file but with the 
cities arranged in descending order of population. 

Each line should still be in the order of 
                            
        'city, country, population'

Note - the population should NOT be followed by a comma
     - the destination file does finish with a blank line

Your function should pass the following doctests:

def order_by_population(file_name, destination_file):
    '''
    >>> order_by_population('world_cities.txt', 'world_cities_by_pop.txt')
    >>> your_file1 = open('world_cities_by_pop.txt')
    >>> our_file1 = open('world_cities_by_pop_answer.txt')
    >>> your_file1.read()== our_file1.read()
    True
    >>> order_by_population('nz_cities.txt', 'nz_cities_by_pop.txt')
    >>> your_file2 = open('nz_cities_by_pop.txt')
    >>> our_file2 = open('nz_cities_by_pop_answer.txt')
    >>> your_file2.read()== our_file2.read()
    True
    >>> your_file1.close()
    >>> our_file1.close()
    >>> your_file2.close()
    >>> our_file2.close()
    '''
