Professor Poplex teaches several different courses. In all of them students sit a number of tests 
each year and their scores, out of a hundred, are recorded. A special prize is awarded to those 
students who meet certain criteria. 

To get a prize students must 

                achieve a certain overall total
                achieve an A+ (90 or higher) in at least half the tests.

The number of tests varies according to the course. The overall total that is required to get a 
prize also varies according to the course.

Write a function that returns the names of the students who have won a prize.

It will need to take: 

                the name of a file containing data for a class 
                the overall total mark required for that course

It should return a string containing the name of each qualifying student followed by a space.

Each line of a data file consists of a student's name and their marks, all separated by commas. 

Your program should pass the doctests as shown.
