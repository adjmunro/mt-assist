The magnitude of an earthquake can be described using the following:

0 to less than 5: Light
5.0 - less than 6: Moderate
6.0 - less than 7: Strong
7.0 +: Major

In a Python script write a function that takes a single argument indicating the magnitude of an 
earthquake. 

The function should return the word describing the magnitude of the earthquake.

Add a main routine that asks the user for a magnitude, passes it to the function and prints out 
the returned value in a sentence as shown below (Where 3.3 is the value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter magnitude: 3.3
An earthquake of magnitude 3.3 is Light.
>>>

You may assume that the user will enter a non-negative number.

Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned value each time.
