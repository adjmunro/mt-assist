Write a function that takes a numerical course mark out of 100 and returns a letter grade. Any mark
80 or greater is an A, 65 up to (but not including) 80 is a B, 50 up to (but not including) 65 is 
a C, 40 up to (but not including) 50 is a D. Anything else is an F.

Add a main routine that asks the user for a mark, passes it to the function and prints out the 
returned value in a sentence as shown below (where 37 is the value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter your mark (between 0 and 100 inclusive): 37
Your grade is F!
>>>

Add further statements to main to test your function with a good selection of hardcoded values. 

You may assume that the user will enter a number between 0 and 100 inclusive.
