The history of Britain is usually divided by historians into a series of periods.
These are often connected with the royal house occupying the throne at the time.        

The periods in modern British history can loosely be described using the
following:

Less than 1485: Pre-Tudor
1485 - less than 1603: Tudor
1603 - less than 1714: Stuart
1714 - less than 1837: Georgian
1837 - less than 1901: Victorian
1901 - less than 1910: Edwardian
1910+ : Windsor

Write a function that takes an int argument representing a year e.g. 1642

The function should return the name of the corresponding period.

Add a main routine that asks the user for a year, passes it to the function and
prints out the returned value in a sentence as shown below (where 1678 is the
value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter a year : 1678
1678 was in the Stuart period.
>>>

Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned value each time.
