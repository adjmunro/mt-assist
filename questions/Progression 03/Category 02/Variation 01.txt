Gold percentages to karats

Alloy metals are added to gold to increase hardness and durability. The level of pure gold is often measured in karats. 

Conversion between a percentage of pure gold and karats(K):

    58.33 up to and including 62.50% is 14K
    75.00 up to and including 79.16% is 18K 
    91.66 up to but NOT including 95.83% is 22K 
    95.83 up to but NOT  including 99.95% is 23K 
    99.95 up to and including 100% is 24K 

Use the table above to write a function called gold_percentage_to_karats. 

The function should take a float representing the percentage of pure gold. It should return a string 
comprising the number of corresponding karats concatenated with a 'K'. If the percentage is not covered 
in the table above simply return "undetermined".

Add a main routine that asks the user for a percentage, passes it to the function and
prints out the returned value in a sentence as shown below (where 76 is the
value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter the percentage of the gold : 76
76.0% pure gold in karats is 18K.
>>>

Alternatively (where 85.2 is the value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter the percentage of the gold : 85.2
85.2% pure gold in karats is undetermined.
>>>

You may assume the user will enter a number between 0 and 100 inclusive.

Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned value each time.
