Write a function called calc_interest_rate which takes 2 arguments:

        a float representing an amount being borrowed

        a Boolean representing whether the loan is secured 
                                (True if it is and False if it is not)

Starting from a base rate of 15.0% the function should calculate and return the actual interest rate which is calculated as follows:

        for an amount over 10,000 the rate is reduced by 1%  unless the amount is over 100,000 in which case it is reduced by 2%.

        the rate for a secured loan is reduced by 2%


Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned interest rate each time. 

When called as follows:

calc_interest_rate(10001, False)

it should return 14.0.

When called as follows:

calc_interest_rate(500000, True)

it should return 11.0.
