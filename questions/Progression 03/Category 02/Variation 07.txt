In a Python script write a function that takes a single argument indicating the latitude of 
somewhere on Earth.
 
If the latitude is between 0 and 23 inclusive, then return 

tropical

If the latitude is greater than 66, then return

polar
 
If the latitude is greater than 23, but less than or equal to 66, then return:

temperate.

Add a main routine that asks the user for their current latitude, passes it to the function and 
prints out the returned value in a sentence as shown (where 12 is the value entered by the user).

>>>
Enter your current latitiude: 12
You are in a tropical zone.
>>>

You may assume that the user will enter a number between 0 and 90 inclusive.

Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned value each time.
