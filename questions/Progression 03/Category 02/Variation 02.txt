Dr Who actors

The reboot of Dr Who has been airing since 2005. The table below shows the main actor playing 
the Doctor for each year since. 

The values are inclusive. (Brief appearances and Christmas specials have been ignored for the sake of simplicity).

Christopher Eccleston: 2005     
David Tennant: 2006-2009
Matt Smith: 2010-2013   
Peter Capaldi: 2014-2017        
Jodie Whittaker: 2018 - 2019

The function should take an int representing a year. It should return the name of the actor playing the Doctor in that year. 

In the event of the year not being covered in the table above simply return "undetermined".

Add a main routine that asks the user for a year, passes it to the function and
prints out the returned value in a sentence as shown below (where 2009 is the
value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter the year : 2009
The main actor playing Dr Who in 2009:  David Tennant.
>>>

Alternatively (where 1999 is the value entered by the user):

>>>
Enter the year : 1999
The main actor playing Dr Who in 1999:  undetermined.
>>>

Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned value each time.
