Based on a simplified Beaufort scale, the table below describes wind conditions:

               Wind speed (km/h)                                  Description
        
                Less than 1                                         calm

                1 or more but less than 50                          breezy
                
                50 or more but less than 89                         gale

                89 or more but less than 118                        storm
                
                118 or more                                         hurricane
                

In a Python script write a function that takes a single argument indicating the wind speed in 
kilometres per hour and returns the appropriate word.

Add a main routine that asks the user for the current wind speed, passes it to the function and 
prints out the returned value, including it in a sentence as shown (where 123 is the value entered by the user and 
hurricane' is the value returned from the function).   

>>>
Enter the current wind speed: 123
Hmmm, you are currently experiencing hurricane conditions.
>>>

You may assume that the user will enter a non-negative number.

Add further statements to the main routine which call the function several times. Be sure to pass in a good selection of 
test data and print out the returned value each time.
