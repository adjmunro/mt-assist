Write a function for a television shopping network that takes 1 argument - the total amount 
they have spent in the past 12 months. It should then return their status.

If they have spent $2000 or more they qualify as 'platinum' customers. Otherwise if the amount is 
$1000 or more they qualify as 'gold' customers. Anyone who has spent anything at all with them 
qualifies as 'silver'. If the customer has spent nothing their status is 'new'.

Add a main routine that asks the user for their name and the amount they have spent and prints 
out a greeting as shown below (where Mary-Lou and 12500 are the values entered by the user):


>>>
Enter your name: Mary-Lou
Enter the amount you have spent with us: $12500
Welcome Mary-Lou! You are a platinum customer.
>>>

Add further statements to main to test your function with a good selection of hardcoded values. 
You may assume that the user will enter a non-negative number.
