Write a function called divide_or_multiply that takes 2 Booleans and 2 ints.

If either (or both) of the Booleans is True the function should print out the
full equation showing the first int divided by the second int. Otherwise the
function should print out the full equation for the multiplication of the 2
ints.

So for example if the function is called like this:

divide_or_multiply(True, False, 13, 5)

the output would be:

>>>
13 / 5 is 2.6
>>>

If the function is called like this:

divide_or_multiply(False, False, 6, 3)

the output would be:

>>>
6 * 3 is 18
>>>

Add a main routine that calls the function several times. Use a good selection of test data. You may assume that the
second number is never zero.
