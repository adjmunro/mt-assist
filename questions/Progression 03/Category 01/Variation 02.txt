In a Python script write a function called are_any_two_equal that takes 3 int 
arguments (x, y and z).

It should return True if x is equal to y, or y is equal to z or x is equal to z, 

It should return False otherwise. 

Add a main routine that calls the function several times and prints out the returned value each time. Pass 
in sensible test values.
