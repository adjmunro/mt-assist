In a Python script write a function called boolean_test that takes two Boolean 
arguments (x and y) and prints out the following Boolean expressions and their 
respective values:

not(x==y)
x or not y

So for example the function might be called like this:

boolean_test(True, False)

In which case the output would be:

>>>
not(True == False) is True
True or not False is True
>>>

Call the function in the main routine several times with a good selection of test values.
