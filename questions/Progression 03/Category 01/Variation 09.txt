Write a function called add_or_subtract that takes 2 Booleans and 2 ints.

If both the Booleans are True the function should print out the full equation
showing the addition of the two ints. Otherwise the function should print out
the full equation for the subtraction of the second int from the first int.

So for example if the function is called like this:

add_or_subtract(True, False, 3, 7)

the output would be:

>>>
3 - 7 is -4
>>>

If it were called like this:

add_or_subtract(True, True, 5, 3)

the output would be:

>>>
5 + 3 is 8
>>>

Add a main routine that calls the function several times. Use a good selection of test data.
