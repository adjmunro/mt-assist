In a Python script write a function called boolean_test that takes two Boolean 
arguments (x and y) and prints the value of the following Boolean expressions:

not x or not y
x and not y

So for example the function could be called like this:

boolean_test(True, False)

in which case the output would be:

>>>
not True or not False is True
True and not False is True
>>>

Call the function in the main routine several times with a good selection of test values.
