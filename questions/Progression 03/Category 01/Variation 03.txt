In a Python script write a function called boolean_test that takes two Boolean 
arguments, named x and y, and prints the value of the following Boolean expressions:

x == y
not(x or y)

So for example the function could be called like this:

boolean_test(True, False)

in which case the output would be:

>>>
True == False is False
not(True or False) is False
>>>

Call the function in the main routine several times with a good selection of test values.
