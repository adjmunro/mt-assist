Simplified Quiz


Add to the QuizQuestion class below so that it passes the doctests. Note the default values that are used when 
an instance of QuizQuestion is made with no arguments.

Add methods to:
        initialise the new instance with:
                the question
                the possible answers - a list containing 4 options
                the index of the correct answer (in the list of possible answers). Stored as an int.
                        (You may trust that this is always a number between 0 and 3 inclusive)
                
        return a string representation of the object(see the doctests)
        
        display the question followed by the possible answers
        each possible answer should be preceded by 4 spaces followed by the appropriate index (0, 1, 2 or 3)
        followed by a colon and a space (see doctests)
                                                
        
        assess the user's answer:
                ask the user to enter 0, 1, 2 or 3 - you may trust that they will enter only one of these options, e.g:
                
                        Please enter your answer as 0, 1, 2 or 3: 
                
                return True if the user has selected the correct answer and False if they have not
        
In the main routine:

        open Questions.txt and use the contents to create a list of QuizQuestion objects
                Example line:
                
                        How many states in the U.S. start with the letter 'M'?,6,7,8,9,2
                
                Note that the question, the 4 possible answers and the answer index are all separated by commas
                
        
        
        loop thought the list of  QuizQuestion objects 
                call the display question method on each object
                call the assess answer method on each object
                
        keep track of how many questions the user gets right and display this at the end e.g:
             
                You scored 2 out of 5
