Write a simple GUI that calculates the total savings achieved by a single deposit (where the interest is compounded annually). 

The application should have:

        an entry box for the original amount in dollars
        an entry box for the number of years over which the interest is being accrued
        an entry box for the annual interest rate as a percent. 

The total accrued amount can be calculated as:
       
       original_amount * (interest_rate/100 + 1 )** number_of_years

The application should have the same layout as shown in the accompanying images (your program
won't pass unless the layout is as shown in the images in the .zip file).
