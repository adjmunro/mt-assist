Write a simple GUI that calculates the temperature after wind chill is considered. 

The application should have:

        an entry box for the current temperature in celsius
        an entry box for the wind speed in km/h

The temperature after factoring in wind chill is calculated as follows:
       
       13.12 + (temp * 0.6215) - (11.37 * wind ** 0.16) + (0.3965 * temp * wind ** 0.16)

where temp is the current temperature and wind is the wind speed.

The application should have the same layout as shown in the accompanying images (your program
won't pass unless the layout is as shown in the images in the .zip file).
