Add to the FuelTank class below so that it passes the doctests. Note the default values that are used when 
an instance of FuelTank is made with no arguments.

Add methods to:
        initialise the new instance with:
                the tank's id code
                the tank's volume
                the tank's fuel current fuel amount - NOTE: all tanks are empty when created
                
        return a string representation of the object
        
        fill the tank with a specified amount of fuel
                        if the total amount exceeds the tank's volume: 
                                        set the fuel amount to the volume
                                        print an alert message (see doctests)   
        
        calculate the tank's remaining capacity
        
        use a specified amount of fuel from the tank
                        if the specified amount exceeds or equals what is in the tank: 
                                        set the fuel amount to zero
                                        print an alert message and state how much fuel was provided (see doctests)
        compare the remaining capacity of this tank to that of another tank - return a reference to the tank with the most remaining capacity
