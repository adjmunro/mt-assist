Exclamation mark abuse

A budding new writer, A. N. Ominous has decided to spurn the idea that exclamation marks should be used sparingly but, 
rather, thinks that they should just be proportional to the length of the string to which they apply.

Write a function called cool_bangs that takes a string. Your function should first remove the last character if it is not a letter. 

It should then return that string where exclamation marks totaling half its length have been added to it. Just use int division to calculate 
half the length.

The following doctests should make it clear:
    
def cool_bangs(s):
    '''
    >>> cool_bangs('Astounding?')
    'Astounding!!!!!'
    >>> cool_bangs('Wow.')
    'Wow!'
    >>> cool_bangs('Yeah')
    'Yeah!!'
    >>> cool_bangs('This deserves some excitement.')
    'This deserves some excitement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
    '''
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)
    

NOTE: Remember to make use of string methods where suitable.
