Generate Usercode

Write a function that takes 2 string parameters, first_name and last_name, and an int.  It 
should generate and return an Otago university usercode. These are always lower case. The 
usercode should consist of the first 3 letters of last_name followed by the first two letters 
of first_name followed by the int. If last_name is shorter than 3 or first_name is shorter than 
2, simply include as many letters as you can.

The function should pass the following doctests.  

def generate_usercode(first_name, last_name, id_num):
    '''
    >>> generate_usercode("Tyrion", "Lannister", 459)
    'lanty459'
    >>> generate_usercode("Arya", "Stark", 1382)
    'staar1382'
    >>> generate_usercode("A", "S", 1382)
    'sa1382'
    ''' 

if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)

NOTE: Remember to make use of string methods where suitable.
