Write a function that accepts a string and concatenates an exclamation mark to the end of it if its length is an odd number. 

It should then use slice notation to return a string that consists of the second half of the string followed by the first half.


The function should pass the following doctests.

def swap_halves(s):
    '''
    >>> swap_halves("aaabbb")
    'bbbaaa'
    >>> swap_halves("aaabbbb")
    'bbb!aaab'
    '''
 
if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
