Remove Bits


Write a function that takes a string, s,  and 4 ints, a, b, c, and d.

If a, b, c and d are not in ascending order or d is greater than the last 
valid index position in s the function should return the original string,
otherwise the function should return a string that consists of 2 substrings of s 
concatenated together. 

The first substring should be between between a and b (inclusive),
the second between c and d (inclusive). 




def remove_bits(s,a,b,c,d):
    '''
    >>> remove_bits('0123456789', 1, 4, 6, 9)
    '12346789'
    >>> remove_bits('0123456789', 1, 4, 6, 10)
    '0123456789'
    >>> remove_bits('My dogs like jumping in the pool on a hot day', 3, 5 ,28, 30)
    'dogpoo'
    >>> remove_bits('My dogs like jumping in the pool on a hot day', 3, 23 ,6, 30)
    'My dogs like jumping in the pool on a hot day'
