Write a function that takes a string and 2 ints representing indexes and returns a string with 
the section between the 2 indexes removed. The removed section should include the first index 
and go up to but not including the second. You may assume the two ints are not out of range. The doctests below should make it clear.

The function should pass the following doctests.

def remove_slice(s, num1, num2):
    '''
    >>> remove_slice("0123456789", 2, 8)
    '0189'
    >>> remove_slice("aaabbc", 3, 5)
    'aaac'
    >>> remove_slice("We love vanilla beans!", 8, 16)
    'We love beans!'
    '''
if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
