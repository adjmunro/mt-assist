Write a function that takes a string and returns a string consisting of the last 2 characters 
followed by the first 2. If the string has fewer than 4 characters then return the whole string.

The function should pass the following doctests.

def two_and_two(string):
    '''
    >>> two_and_two('The quick brown fox')
    'oxTh'
    >>> two_and_two('We scream for ice cream')
    'amWe'
    >>> two_and_two('Sky')
    'Sky'
    '''
    
if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
