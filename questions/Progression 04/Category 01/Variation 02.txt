python to camelCase

According to python naming conventions each new word in an identifier is preceded by an underscore, e.g.:

        student_age

        calculate_tax

In many other languages camel case naming style is used where each new word in an identifier starts with a capital letter
e.g.:

        studentAge

        calculateTax

Write a function that takes a string representing a python identifier and returns it in camel case form. You may assume the 
input string contains either either one or zero underscores.  HINT: use slices.

Your function should pass the following doctests:

def python_to_camelCase(python_string_id):
    '''
    >>> python_to_camelCase("student_age")
    'studentAge'
    >>> python_to_camelCase("qwerty_xxx")
    'qwertyXxx'
    >>> python_to_camelCase("age")
    'age'
    >>> python_to_camelCase("xxx")
    'xxx'
    
    '''
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)

NOTE: Remember to make use of string methods where suitable.
