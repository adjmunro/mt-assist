Check Passcode

Write a function that takes a string of digits, representing a passcode, and 2 ints, x and y. 
It should return True if the passcode is valid and False if it is not. To be valid the 
passcode must have a length that is between the 2 ints (inclusive) and the sum of the individual 
digits must be a multiple of the length.

You may trust that the string argument contains only digits. You may also trust that 
y is greater than or equal to x.

The function should pass the following doctests.

def check_code(code_string, x, y):
    '''
    >>> check_code("234", 4, 7)
    False
    >>> check_code("234", 3, 7)
    True
    >>> check_code("2365", 2, 7)
    True
    >>> check_code("2365", 2, 3)
    False
    >>> check_code("5683459", 6, 10)
    False
    '''

if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
