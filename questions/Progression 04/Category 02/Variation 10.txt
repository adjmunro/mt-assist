Distinct Letters

Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of distinct
letters it contains. 

Hint: Start with an empty string called distinct and as you loop concatenate
to it only letters that the distinct string does not already contain i.e. distinct letters.

It should pass the following doctests:

def count_distinct_letters(s):
    '''   
    >>> count_distinct_letters('aaaaaa')
1
    >>> count_distinct_letters('1234')
0
    >>> count_distinct_letters('qwerty1234')
6
    >>> count_distinct_letters('qqwweerrttyy1234')
6
    '''
    
    distinct = "" 


    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)
