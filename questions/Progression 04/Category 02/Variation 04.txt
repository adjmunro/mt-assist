Caesar Cipher

Write a function that takes a string and an int. It should return an encoded string using a 
simple Caesar cipher.

Note: The ord function takes a single character string and returns its equivalent ordinal number. 
The chr function takes an int and returns the one-character string that has that ordinal number.

So 

ord('a') gives 97

chr(97) gives 'a'

chr (ord('a') + 2) gives 'c'

Iterate through the string , incrementing the ordinal number of each character by the int parameter and 
converting back to a char. Spaces, however, should remain as spaces.

The function should pass the following doctests.

def caesar_cipher(s, i):
    '''
    >>> caesar_cipher("abcd", 2)
    'cdef'
    >>> caesar_cipher("The quick", 3)
    'Wkh txlfn'
    '''

if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
