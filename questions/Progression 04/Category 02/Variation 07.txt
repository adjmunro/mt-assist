camelCase to python  


According to python naming conventions each new word in an identifier is preceded by an underscore, e.g.:

        student_age

        calculate_tax

In many other languages camel case naming style is used where each new word in an identifier starts with a capital letter 
e.g.:

        studentAge

        calculateTax

Write a function that takes a string representing a camel case identifier and return it in python form. 

Your function should pass the following doctests:  
    
def camelCase_to_python(camelCaseStringId):
    '''
    >>> camelCase_to_python("studentAge")
    'student_age'
    >>> camelCase_to_python("qwertyXxx")
    'qwerty_xxx'
    >>> camelCase_to_python("age")
    'age'
    >>> camelCase_to_python("xxx")
    'xxx'
    >>> camelCase_to_python('whatAVeryLongMethodName')
    'what_a_very_long_method_name'
    '''
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)
