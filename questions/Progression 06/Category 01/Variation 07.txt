Write a function that asks the user for a full file name (including the extension) until an 
acceptable type is entered and then returns it.  Accepted file types are: '.py', '.java', '.txt'. 

You may wish to use the rfind method from str.

The function should use a while loop.

The function should offer sensible feedback to the user and be able to produce the behaviour 
shown below:


>>> file_name_1 = get_file_name()
Please enter your file name: qwerty.docx
.docx is not a permitted file type!
Please enter your file name: qwerty.rtf
.rtf is not a permitted file type!
Please enter your file name: qwerty.TXT
.TXT is not a permitted file type!
Please enter your file name: qwerty.txt
>>> file_name_1
qwerty.txt'
>>> file_name_2 = get_file_name()
Please enter your file name: qwerty.two.txt
>>> file_name_2
qwerty.two.txt'
>>>
