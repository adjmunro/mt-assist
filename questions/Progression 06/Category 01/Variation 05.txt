Write a function called get_ird_number that asks the user for their IRD number until a valid one 
is entered. IRD numbers must be either 8 or 9 digits long, with no non-digit characters.

The function should use a while loop.

The function should offer some feedback to the user and be able to produce the behaviour shown 
below:

>>> my_ird = get_ird_number()
Please enter your ird number (just numbers, no spaces or slashes etc): 1234
1234 is not a valid IRD number. Please try again.
Please enter your ird number (just numbers, no spaces or slashes etc): 123412341234

Please enter your ird number (just numbers, no spaces or slashes etc): 123-456-7
