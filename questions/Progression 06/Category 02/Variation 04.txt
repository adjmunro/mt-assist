Requires File: 88.zip

Write a function that takes a string argument representing a filename and an int argument, x.
 
The function should open the file and, using a while loop, return a string containing the first x 
words that start with a capital letter. Each word should be followed by a space. If the file 
contains fewer than x words that start with a capital, the function should simply include all the words in the file that do.

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part 
of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:   

def first_x_capitalised_words(filename, x):
    '''
    >>> first_x_capitalised_words('wuthering_heights.txt', 5)
    "Wuthering Heights Mr. Heathcliff's Pure, "
    >>> first_x_capitalised_words('styles.txt', 3)
    'I Front Convalescent '
    >>> first_x_capitalised_words('phrase.txt', 30)
    'Hello World! '
    '''

    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)
