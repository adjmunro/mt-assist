Requires File: 85.zip

Write a function that takes a single string representing a filename as an argument and a number, 
x.

The function should then open the file and, using a while loop, return a string containing every 
xth word. The returned string should start with the first word and each word in it should be 
followed by a space. 

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.


Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part 
of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:

def every_xth_word(filename,  x):
    '''
    >>> every_xth_word('right_ho_jeeves.txt', 150)
    '"Jeeves," out Cannes to home covered country, nothing some are sir. out '
    >>> every_xth_word('wuthering_heights.txt', 24)
    'Wuthering is north range it paused crumbling requested complete '
    >>> every_xth_word('anthem.txt', 7)
    'God the our free the her Zealand. '
    >>> every_xth_word('styles.txt', 12)
    'I months leave up I had my As place it leave '
    '''


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
