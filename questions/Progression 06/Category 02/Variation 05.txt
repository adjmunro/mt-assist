Requires File: 123.zip

Write a function called words_with_position_multiple_of_length that takes a single string 
representing a filename as an argument.

The function should open the file and return a string. The string should consist of every 
word whose position in the file is a multiple of the word's length unless it has a length of 1. 


The returned string should start with the first word that meets the criteria and each word in it 
should be followed by a space. You must use a while loop to traverse the file contents.

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part 
of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:

def words_with_position_multiple_of_length(filename):
    '''
    >>> words_with_position_multiple_of_length("bleak_house_1.txt")
    'CHAPTER In and in in if waters the of the it meet feet or waddling an lizard of in as big as one for in to their '
    >>> words_with_position_multiple_of_length("styles.txt")
    'home the months given no to up to him some had him He fifteen my one he his As often at old it in his inviting leave '
    '''

if __name__ == "__main__":    
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose = True)
