Requires File: 77.zip

Write a function called words_that_contain that takes two file names and a string. The first file 
name is the file to be read and processed, the second is the destination file for your answer.

The function should open the given file for processing and then write out to the destination file 
every word that contains exactly the given string (i.e. it is case-sensitive), followed by a space.

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.


Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part 
of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:

def words_that_contain(file_name, destination, string):
    >>> words_that_contain("styles.txt",'q2_answer1.txt', "th")
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('special_words_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
    True
    >>> words_that_contain('bleak_house.txt','q2_answer2.txt', "an")
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer2.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('special_words_answer2.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
    True
