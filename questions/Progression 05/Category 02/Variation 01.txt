Requires File: 74.zip

Write a function called save_words_starting_with that takes two file names and a letter. 
The first file name is the file to be read and processed, the second is the destination 
file for your answer.

The function should open the given file for processing and then write out to the 
destination file every word which starts with the letter argument, followed by a space. 
It should include words that start with both the upper case and lower case version of the 
letter.

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part
of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:

def save_words_starting_with(file_name, destination, letter):
    """
    >>> save_words_starting_with("anthem.txt",'q2_answer1.txt', 'd')
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('save_words_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
