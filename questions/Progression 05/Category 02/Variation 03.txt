Requires File: 76.zip

Write a function called save_words_longer_than that takes two file names and a number 
representing a minimum length. The first file name is the file to be read and processed, the 
second is the destination file for your answer.

The function should open the given file for processing and then write out to the destination 
file all the words that have a length longer than or equal to the given number. Each word 
should be followed by a space.

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:

def save_words_longer_than(file_name, destination, number):
    """
    >>> save_words_longer_than("styles.txt",'q2_answer1.txt', 6)
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('longer_than_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
    True
    >>> save_words_longer_than("anthem.txt",'q2_answer2.txt', 8)
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer2.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('longer_than_answer2.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
