Requires File: 75.zip

Words that start with a character whose ord is a multiple of a specified int

Remember: The ord function takes a single character string and returns its equivalent ordinal number. 

So: 

        ord('a') returns 97

        ord('b') returns 98

        ord('A') returns 65

Write a function called words_starting_with_multiple that takes two file names and an int.
The first file name is the file to be read and processed, the second is the destination 
file for your answer.

The function should open the given file for processing and then write out to the 
destination file all the words that start with a character whose ord is a multiple of the 
int argument.

E.g

If the int argument was 5 and the file contained the word dog, then dog would be one of 
the words written out to the destination file. This is because the ord of 'd' is 100 and 100 is a 
multiple of 5.  Each word should be followed by a space.

Remember to have all the required files in the same directory as the python file.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part of the word.

Your function should pass the doctests below:



def words_starting_with_multiple(file_name, destination, num):
    '''
    >>> words_starting_with_multiple("styles.txt",'q2_answer1.txt', 6)
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('words_starting_with_multiple_answer1.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
    True
    >>> words_starting_with_multiple("bleak_house.txt",'q2_answer2.txt', 8)
    >>> sfile = open('q2_answer2.txt')
    >>> text_s = sfile.read()
    >>> cfile = open('words_starting_with_multiple_answer2.txt')
    >>> text_c = cfile.read()
    >>> sfile.close()
    >>> cfile.close()
    >>> text_s == text_c
    True
    '''
