Requires File: 72.zip

Write a function that takes a file name and two bigrams as arguments. A bigram is a sequence of any two characters (for example, 'ch').

The function should open the file (remember to have the file in the same directory as the python file)

The function should count and return the number of words that contain one or both of the bigrams.

The function should include capitalised or partially capitalised versions of the bigrams in the count.

The function should pass the following doctests:

def count_words_with_bigrams(file_name, bigram1, bigram2):
    '''
    >>> count_words_with_bigrams('bleak_house.txt', 'th', 'ch')
415
    >>> count_words_with_bigrams('styles.txt', 'th', 'ch')
9
    >>> count_words_with_bigrams('test_1.txt', 'th', 'ch')
4
    '''
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
