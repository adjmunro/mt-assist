Requires File: 69.zip

Write a function that takes 2 arguments - a file name and a single character string. 

The function should open the file and return the last word in the file that starts with the character argument. The character 
is case-sensitive, i.e. 'K' is considered different to 'k'.

If there is not a word in the file that starts with the given character the function should just return an empty string.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part of the word.

Remember to have the files in the same directory as the python file.

The function should pass the following doctests:

def last_word_to_start_with(file_name, ch):
    '''
    >>> last_word_to_start_with('bleak_house.txt', 'F')
    'For'
    >>> last_word_to_start_with('styles.txt', 'r')
    'ran'
    >>> last_word_to_start_with('styles.txt', 'X')
    ''
    '''

if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
