Requires File: 66.zip

Write a function that takes a single string argument representing the name of 
a file that contains ints separated by spaces. The function should return the 
largest number in the file. You may trust that the file will only contain 
space-separated ints and will not be empty.

Remember to have the files in the same directory as the python file.

The function should pass the following doctests:

def find_largest_num(file_name):
    '''
    >>> find_largest_num('numbers.txt')
87998
    >>> find_largest_num('numbers_2.txt')
125
    '''
    
if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
