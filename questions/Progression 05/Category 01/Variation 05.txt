Requires File: 70.zip

Write a function that takes two strings as arguments, a file name and a word to find.

The function should open the file (remember to have the file in the same directory as the python file).

The function should then count how many times the target word appears in the file and return the answer.

In order to match, the word(s) in the document do NOT need to be the same case as the argument.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part 
of the word. The word 'apple' is NOT expected to match 'apple.'

The function should pass the following doctests:

def word_count(file_name, target):

    """
    >>> word_count("anthem.txt", "defend")
2
    >>> word_count("anthem.txt", "love")
1
    >>> word_count("anthem.txt", "banana")
0
    >>> word_count("anthem.txt", "god")
3
    >>> word_count("anthem.txt", 'go')
0
    """
