Requires File: 67.zip

Write a function that takes a file name and 2 ints as arguments and
returns the number of words in the file that have a length between the 2 numbers
(inclusive). 

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part of the word.

Remember to have the files in the same directory as the python file.

The function should pass the following doctests:

def count_words_with_len_in_range(file_name, x, y):
    '''
    >>> count_words_with_len_in_range('bleak_house.txt', 8, 9)
275
    >>> count_words_with_len_in_range('styles.txt', 1, 3)
55
    >>> count_words_with_len_in_range('test_2.txt', 4, 7)
4
    '''
    
if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
