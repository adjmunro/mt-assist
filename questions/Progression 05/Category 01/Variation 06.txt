Requires File: 71.zip

Write a function that takes a file name as an argument. 

The function should open the file (remember to have the file in the same directory as the python 
file)

The function should then return the first word that does NOT start with a capital letter. 
If all of them do start with capital letters, it should return an empty string.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part of the word.

The function should pass the following doctests:

def find_first_non_capitalised(file_name):
    '''
    >>> find_first_non_capitalised('bleak_house.txt')
    'term'
    >>> find_first_non_capitalised('styles.txt')
    'had'
    >>> find_first_non_capitalised('test_4.txt')
    ''
    '''


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
