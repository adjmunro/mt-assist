Requires File: 68.zip

Write a function that takes a single string argument representing a file name.

The function should open the file (remember to have the files in the same directory as the python file).

The function should then count how many times the words "God" or "Lord" are in the file.

Note: You do not have to strip punctuation. Commas and full stops etc are just treated as a part of the word. 
God. is not expected to match "God"

The function should pass the following doctests:

def count_religious_references(filename):
    """
    >>> count_religious_references("anthem.txt")
3
    >>> count_religious_references("anthem_uk.txt")
7
    >>> count_religious_references("anthem_au.txt")
0
    >>> count_religious_references("lorde.txt")
0
    """


if __name__== "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
