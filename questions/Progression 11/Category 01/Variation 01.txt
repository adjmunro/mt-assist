Write a function called create_dict that takes a file name as an argument. The function should read each line in 
the file and split it on the comma. The first string should become a key, the second string should be the corresponding 
value.

In the doctests, using the first file provided, the function is creating a dictionary where each key is a state in the USA
and the corresponding value is the state's capital city. Using the second, the function is creating a dictionary where each
key is a state in the USA and the corresponding value is the state's official abbreviation. 

Be sure leading and trailing whitespace is removed from the strings before they are entered in the dictionary.
Hint: dir(str)

You may be certain that there is only one comma per line of text in the file and the file contains no duplicates. 

The function should pass the doctests shown below: 

def create_dict(filename):
    '''
    >>> state_capitals = create_dict("state_capitals.txt")
    >>> sorted(state_capitals.values())[:5]
    ['Albany', 'Annapolis', 'Atlanta', 'Augusta', 'Austin']
    >>> state_capitals['Hawaii']
    'Honolulu'
    >>> state_capitals['New Mexico']
    'Santa Fe'
    >>> state_abbreviations = create_dict("state_abbreviations.txt")
    >>> sorted(state_abbreviations.values())[-5:]
    ['VT', 'WA', 'WI', 'WV', 'WY']
    >>> state_abbreviations['Hawaii']
    'HI'
    >>> state_abbreviations['New Mexico']
    'NM'
    '''
