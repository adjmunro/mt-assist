Create a Python script that asks the user for their name and two numbers - the cost of an 
item that they wish to purchase and the number of months over which they wish to spread the 
interest-free payments. 

It should then print how much they will have to pay per month. Your program should behave 
like this ('Alice', 3000.0 and 30 are the values entered by the user):

>>>
Enter your name:  Alice
Enter the cost of the item in dollars: 3000.0
Enter how many months: 30
Alice you will have to pay $100.0 per month.
>>>
