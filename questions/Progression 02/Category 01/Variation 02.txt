Create a Python script that asks the user for a name and then asks for a number representing how many times the  name should
be printed. It should then create and print a string with the name and an exclamation mark repeated the correct
number of times. 

You may assume the user will enter an int for the number value.

Your program should behave like this (Bob and 3 are the values entered by the user):

>>>
Enter your name: Bob
Enter how many: 3
Bob!Bob!Bob!
>>>
