A group of friends are pooling equal amounts of their money to buy a gift for another friend's 
birthday. Write a python script that asks the user for the name of the friend and then how 
many friends want to 'chip in' and the total price of the gift they wish to purchase.  Print 
how much each person has to pay if they split the cost evenly. 

Your program should behave like this ('Bill', 6 and 129.0 are the values entered by the user):

>>>
Whose birthday is it?: Bill
Enter the number of friends contributing to the present: 6
Enter the total amount you wish to spend in dollars: 129.0
Each friend needs to pay $21.5 towards the present for Bill
