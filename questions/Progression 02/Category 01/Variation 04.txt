Create a python script that asks the user their name and how much a house costs and how much they 
have as a deposit. Calculate and display how much they have to borrow as a percentage. 

Your program should behave like this (100000.0 and 30000.0 are the values entered by the user 
(Alice)):

>>>
Enter your name:  Alice
Enter price of the house: 100000.0
Enter amount of deposit: 30000.0
Alice, you will have to borrow 70.0% of the cost.
