A group of friends are sharing the cost of a gift for another friend's birthday equally. Write a 
python script that asks the user how many friends want to 'chip in' and the amount that they have 
agreed each person will pay and the friends name.  Print how much they can spend on the gift. 

Your program should behave like this (Where 7 friends are contributing and they each wish to spend $15.50. It 
is Alice's birthday):


>>>
Whose birthday is it?:  Alice
Enter the number of friends contributing to the present: 7
Enter the amount you each wish to spend in dollars: 15.5
Together you can afford a gift for Alice that costs $108.5
