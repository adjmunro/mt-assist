A 10 litre tin of emulsion paint covers approximately 130 square metres. Create a Python script 
that asks the user for their name and then the width and height of a plain wall to be painted
in metres. It should then calculate and display how much area they will still be able to paint 
afterwards.  

Your program should behave like this (6.5 and 3.2 are the values entered by 
the user (Alice)):

>>>
Enter your name:  Alice
Enter width of wall in metres: 6.5
Enter height of wall in metres: 3.2
Alice, you will still be able to paint approximately 109.2 square metres.
