Create a Python script that asks the user for their name and then two numbers, the cost 
of an item that they wish to purchase and how much they wish to pay per month. Calculate 
and print how many months it will take for them to pay off the item (interest-free and with 
no deposit). 

Your program should behave like this (3000.0 and 30.0 are the values entered by the user):

>>>
Enter your name:  Alice
Enter the cost of the item in dollars: 3000.0
Enter amount you wish to pay per month (in dollars): 30.0
Alice, you will take 100.0 months to pay this off.
