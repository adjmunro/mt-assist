In a script write a function that takes four arguments x, y, z, p and prints the
average of x, y and z, raised to the power of p.
  
Call the function from the main routine. For example the function could be called like this:

func_name(7,3,8,4)

which should print out 1296.0

Add a main routine that calls the function several times passing in values of your choosing.
