 Currency conversion

Write a function called currency_conversion that takes two arguments: 
        a float representing an amount of money
        a string representing a currency. 

It should then ask the user for the current exchange rate to New Zealand dollars and display the amount in New Zealand 
dollars.

When called as follows:

        currency_conversion(1000.0, "British pounds")

Your function should display:

        Please enter the conversion rate from British pounds to $NZ: 1.88
        1000.0 British pounds is currently 1880.0 New Zealand dollars.

where 1.88 is the value entered by the user.

Call the function twice in the main routine - the first time to convert 2000 US dollars, the second to convert 4000 Euros. 
( The actual conversion rates at the time these questions were written were 1.47 and 1.68 respectively but you may 
enter what you like so long as it is a number.)
