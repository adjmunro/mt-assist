In a Python script write a function called FBI_name_badge that takes 2 arguments
(fname and lname) and prints out the line:

fname' 'lname' is an FBI Special Agent.

Add a main routine that prompts the user for a first name and then a last name and stores them in
two variables. 

The main routine then calls FBI_name_badge sending it the user inputs.

e.g. For the user inputs 'Fred' and 'Blogs' the program will produce the line:

Fred Blogs is an FBI Special Agent.
