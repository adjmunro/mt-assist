Write a function that takes 3 arguments: the name of a sport, the number of players required for 
each team (including 2 subs) and the number of children that have signed up for that sport. Print 
out the sport and how many complete teams can be formed.

In the main routine call the function twice. For example the function could be called like 
this:

calc_teams("Soccer", 13, 149)
calc_teams("Netball", 9, 123)

which should produce output similar to:

>>>
Soccer: 11 complete teams
Netball: 13 complete teams
>>>
