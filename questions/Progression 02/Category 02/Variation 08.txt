Write a Python script which defines a function called name_of_capital. 

The function should take an argument representing the name of a country. It should then prompt 
the user for the capital city of that country and store it in a variable called capital_name. 
Finally the function should finish with a statement which prints out a summary of the 
information.

For instance, if the function is called with the argument 'Argentina', it should behave as shown below
(where 'Buenos Aires' is the value entered by the user):


>>>
Enter the capital of Argentina: Buenos Aires
You claim the capital of Argentina is Buenos Aires.
>>>

In the main routine, the function should be called twice.

The first time the argument should be: ' Samoa'

The second time the argument should be:  'Italy'
