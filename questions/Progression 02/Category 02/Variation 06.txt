Write a function that takes an argument representing a distance in miles and prints the 
equivalent distance in kilometres. Base your calculation on 1 mile = 1.61km.

In the main routine ask the user to enter the number of miles. Call the function, passing in this 
value.

If the user enters 7.6 your program should produce the following output:

7.6 miles is 12.236km

Call the function several more times in the main routine, passing in sensible test values.
