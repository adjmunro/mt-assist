In a script write a function that takes four arguments, a, b, c, d, and prints the 
sum of a raised to the b, and c raised to the power of d. 

For example the function might be called like this:

func_name(3,2,4,2)

which would print out 25.

Add a main routine that calls the function several times passing in the values of your choosing.
