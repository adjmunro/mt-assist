The story goes that as a child, the mathemetician Carl Gauss(1777 - 1855) was set the task of adding up the numbers 
from one to a hundred. Much to his teacher's astonishment (and possibly annoyance) he solved it in a minute. Young Carl 
had realised that rather than add 1 + 2 + 3 + .. + 99 + 100, he could form 50 equal pairs:

1              +              100               = 101
  2            +           99           = 101
    3          +        98              = 101


And so on. This becomes a simple multiplication:

50 * 101 = 5050

Although this technique can be used with any starting point we will keep it simple and always start from one.

Write a function, add_sequence, that takes an int, upper_limit, and prints out the sum of all the numbers from 1 up to and
including upper_limit using Gauss's formula which:

                divides the upper limit by 2 (using floating point division)

                multiplies that number by the upper limit plus one 
                

When called as follows:
                add_sequence(15)

Your function should display the result:

                The sum of all the integers between 1 and 15 inclusive is 120.

Note: the result is displayed as an int.

In the main routine ask the user to enter a number. Call the function passing in the number obtained from the user.
You may assume the user will enter a positive number.

Call the function several more times using sensible hardcoded values.
