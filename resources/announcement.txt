These are your Mastery Test Questions.
Obviously we cannot invigilate these tests in the usual fashion so we are relying on students to not cheat.
Remember:

- This is a closed book test, you must not use the internet, friends or other sources to help you.
- You must not share these questions (or your answers to them) with other people.
- You should time yourself, you have 45 minutes for this test. At the end of that time you should put yourself on DemoCall to have your answers checked, whether they work or not.
